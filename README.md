# Credit-Card-Anamoly-detection

## üìù Project Background and Overview

With the rapid growth of digital transactions, credit card fraud has become a pressing issue for financial institutions and payment processors. Detecting fraudulent activity in real time is essential to minimize financial losses and protect customer trust.

This project utilizes anonymized credit card transaction data collected over two days, encompassing over **280,000 records**. The primary aim is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying potentially fraudulent transactions. By analyzing patterns in transaction behavior, time, and engineered features, the goal is to develop a robust, data-driven approach that enhances fraud detection capabilities while minimizing false positives.

This project investigates credit card transaction data to uncover fraud patterns and improve detection accuracy. It analyzes transactional behavior across time, amount ranges, and anonymized features to identify suspicious activity. By exploring fraud frequency, transaction value, and temporal trends, the analysis pinpoints high-risk periods and behavioral anomalies that help guide targeted prevention strategies.

Leveraging **Python** for data wrangling, modeling, and visualization, the project applies both **supervised** (XGBoost, Logistic Regression) and **unsupervised** (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) algorithms. Among these, a tuned **XGBoost classifier**‚Äîoptimized via cross-validation and hyperparameter search‚Äîdemonstrates superior performance in identifying fraud. Furthermore, the decision threshold is fine-tuned post-training to maximize **recall** while preserving high **precision**, minimizing missed frauds without overwhelming the system with false alarms.

Evaluation includes industry-standard performance metrics, with a focus on **AUC-ROC** and **Precision-Recall (PR)** curves. While ROC-AUC measures overall classification power, PR-AUC is emphasized due to the extreme class imbalance in fraud detection, offering a more sensitive measure of the model‚Äôs ability to identify rare fraud cases.

An interactive dashboard complements the analysis by surfacing actionable fraud insights for stakeholders. It tracks core fraud KPIs and model performance:

### üìä Fraud Distribution KPIs
- **Fraud Count by Hour** ‚Äì Frequency of fraud by hour of day.  
- **Fraud Rate by Hour** ‚Äì Percentage of hourly transactions that are fraudulent.  
- **Fraud Amount by Hour** ‚Äì Total value of fraud over time intervals.

### üí∞ Transaction-Based KPIs
- **Fraud Amount Distribution** ‚Äì Spread of fraud values across transactions.  
- **Fraud Count by Amount Range** ‚Äì Bucketed transaction values to highlight fraud-prone ranges.

### üìà Model Evaluation KPIs
- **AUC-ROC & PR-AUC** ‚Äì Classification strength with an emphasis on recall under class imbalance.  
- **Threshold Optimization** ‚Äì Custom tuning of the XGBoost decision threshold to improve fraud recall.  
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** ‚Äì Key metrics guiding model selection.  
- **Feature Importance** ‚Äì Top predictors of fraud surfaced through model interpretation.

This end-to-end fraud detection solution not only uncovers vulnerabilities in transaction data but also empowers stakeholders with actionable insights and model-backed risk indicators through a streamlined, code-driven analytical workflow.

  Introducing real-time monitoring with increased alert thresholds could help prevent fraud during these critical periods.

- **Enhance Fraud Detection for Higher Transaction Amounts**  
  Fraud rates increase significantly as transaction amounts rise, particularly for amounts **over $500**.  
  It is advised to apply additional scrutiny or implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for large transactions, as they tend to exhibit higher fraud risks.

- **Feature Utilization**  
  Features like **V4, V14**, and **V12**, which show strong separation between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, should be prioritized in the model.  
  These features are **critical fraud indicators** and can help refine detection models for better accuracy.

- **Transaction Timing Optimization**  
  Fraud detection algorithms should incorporate **time-of-day patterns**, with heightened focus on **evening hours** when fraudulent activity peaks.  
  Targeted alerts during these periods could significantly reduce fraud-related losses.

- **Threshold Adjustment for Optimal Sensitivity**  
  Adjusting the fraud detection threshold to optimize for **recall** while maintaining **precision** is essential.  
  Based on model performance, a **threshold of 0.70** is recommended to balance the trade-off between detecting fraud and reducing false positives, thereby improving overall accuracy.
